###Optical illusions

As you test the design, you will have to trust your perceptions and design somewhat practically.
Much of type design requires that you make letters similar and that you repeat forms.

It is tempting to assume that if you measure the parts and the spaces between the glyphs, then you
will get reliable results. While very useful, this approach has real limitations. You should expect
to make adjustments if something looks wrong to you. Furthermore, you should feel confident that
making changes until it “looks right” is the correct thing to do.

The reason this is true is that there are a number of natural optical illusions that all readers are
subject to. These illusions must be accounted for by altering the shapes of letters until they look
right to you.

Some illusions involve the perceived weight of lines, some involve the perceived length of lines,
and others involve the eye’s perception of shapes.

- 2 + 2 = 5: Making strokes look the same width
- vertical and horizontal strokes H
- vertical and diagonal strokes n v
- straight and curved strokes - n o 
- Diagonal stroke overlap - x & dv_chu

### Horizontal vs. vertical weight

The example on the left shows an ‘H’ which bars are precisely equal in thickness. This looks wrong.
Can you feel it?  
The other one on the right has a horizontal bar which has has been thinned to appear equal in
thickness.

Glyphs in which optical adjustments have to be made are numerous and include A, E, F, L, H, f, t,
and z.

### Diagonal thickness

Similarly, if you have bars of the same width and one of them is set at a diagonal, the diagonal bar
will seem slightly heavier than the vertical bar and slightly thinner than the horizontal. If you
want it look right, you will have to adjust it to be lighter like the horizontal example, but just a
little less.

Glyphs in which this human perception may be relevant are quite numerous but include k, K, N, Q, R,
v, V, w, W, x, X, y, Y, 7, 2, &amp;, ł, Ł, &oslash;, &Oslash;, &radic;, ∕, &lsaquo;, &rsaquo;,
&laquo;, &raquo;, &frac12;, &frac13;, &frac14;, &le;, &ge;, and &times;.

### Length and perceived diagonal angle

Longer shapes need to slant less than short shapes in order to give the appearance of same slant.

The image below has diagonal lines that are all at the same angle. The long one appears to be at a
different angle.

In the next picture below, the slant of the longer line has been adjusted:

Now let’s look at an actual italic, applying these corrections to the glyphs:

### Crossing diagonals

When a bar crosses another diagonal or a straight line, it will need adjustments to not appear as
misaligned.

<img src="images/compare-x.png" alt>

In the example above, the X on the left has two unadjusted bars crossing each other. The example on
the right has been adjusted so that they appear to be aligned.

<img src="images/myriad-x.png" alt>

As you can see in this X with dotted line on top of it, the X that appears visually aligned involves an offset.

Glyphs in which this illusion is relevant include x, X, k, K, ×, #, and the icelandic letter ‘eth’
(&eth;).

### Perceived height

The shape of a glyph will contribute to how high it needs to be in order to look as if it is the
same height as the other glyphs. Round glyphs need to overshoot the height of flat glyphs by a
little bit. Glyphs which have pointier shapes will need to overshoot more. The sharper the shape,
the more it will need to overshoot in order to look correct.

<img src="images/3Shapes.png" alt>

In the image above, the top three shapes are unadjusted &mdash; that is, they have identical
heights. The three shapes on the bottom have been adjusted so that they appear more similar in
height.

This illusion is relevant for any glyph that has parts which are either round or pointy. These
include O, Q, C, S, A, V, W, and so on.
