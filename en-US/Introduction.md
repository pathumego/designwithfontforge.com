###Can anyone learn this? 
- How good are you at drawing? Does it matter?
- background education that is helpful 
   - typography (print + web), illustration, history of art, linguistics, programming, how to earn a living as a  freelance designer

###Typography vs Type design vs Lettering

Graphic Design is the craft of combining photography, illustration and typography into effective pieces of visual communication, for the purposes of advertising, entertaining or informing people. (ref Understanding Comics)
Type design means making mechanised letters; letters that can be used for any text. Lettering is making letters for a known piece of text, and is often close to illustration and with an emphasis on calligraphic traditional forms (swirly swirly) 

- Type design is the craft of making type. Typography is the art & craft of using type

- Type Design is (Gerry Definition from Octavio Slides) 

### What is a font? (A simple quick guideline- more in font engineering section)

####Font vs typeface

- Typeface is a collection of letters designed to work together 

- Letter = Character + Glyph: Characters have codepoints, and sets of codepoints were called encodings. Platform encodings (eg Mac vs PC) met the Internet and that led to Unicode, a single encoding for everything.

- Glyph Names for designers (can be anything) 

- Shaping Tables: say in a sentence or two that fonts go beyond simple, A B C, to ligatures - fi, ffi, ffl - and most of the world’s writing systems (scripts) are ‘complex’ scripts where every syllable is a ligature, eg
क + ख = क्ख

- Rendering Tables (Hinting)
- Metadata: say in a sentence or two that a font file contains 'metadata': name of the font family and style, vertical metrics, licensing information, etc


The single biggest issue that makes type design different is the need for every glyph in the typeface to work with every other glyph. This often means that the design and spacing of each part of the typeface ends up being a series of careful compromises. These compromises mean that we can best think about typeface design as the creation of a wonderful collection of letters but not as a collection of wonderful letters. In other words we must think about the group and how it will perform together and prioritize this over any question of what is wonderful in a single letter.

This need to prioritize with the system rather than with any single part also leads to a need to analyse our design process on the level of the system. Characteristics which span letters become the things we want to focus on, particularly at the beginning of the design process.

The other oddity in type design is that to a very large extent the forms we are designing are already significantly established. Our task as type designers is not so much to create an utterly new form but rather to create a new version of an existing form. This can perplex new type designers. Finding just the right amount to change in order to excite but not to alienate a reader is a tricky thing. Often designers get stuck in letter-specific thinking. This mistake can be easily avoided if you realize from the start that what is most meaningful in a typeface are the parts of it that repeat the most. Typeface design is not just about designing the characteristics applied to the common forms we all recognize, but also to the forms that occur most often.

It is also useful to recognize that these characteristics not only help to create a font’s voice or atmosphere, but also determine what the font will or will not be useful for, and they sometimes help determine the technological contexts for which a font is suitable.

It may seem intimidating or excessively abstract to think about the design of a font in this way. However, getting used to these ideas is the key to a faster, more effective, and satisfying type design process.

###Why a font editor

- Iterative nature of type design: keep the iteration loop tight and fast
