###Proportions 
Generic description with examples from few scripts
- heights: 
  - base, 
  - asc/desc, 
  - x, 
  - cap
  
###widths

- grid? why it works, why it does NOT work. 
  - some behance thing vs romain du roi
- the intuitive sense of the native reader (you donâ€™t know your own grammar, but you could tell me english grammar if you learned it as a foreign language)
  - this is really your own (unconscious) life long study of historical/conventional proportion model
- frank bloklands latin lettermodel shows its possible to analyse this unconcious proportion model, but
  - maybe find old linotype examples with unitized widths for other scripts?
