###Unified Font Repository

Unified Font Repository is a proposal for the standardization of typeface design in an open source context. It also aims for the promotion of open source typography by introducing a transversal and flexible classification. Technically, UFR is a folder architecture to organize font sources, inspirations and references. It is also a YAML file with useful meta informations about the typeface and its repository.
